# Place-to-Wake

Place to wake is a personal project made as a school exercise to explore the Jetpack Compose environment. 
The goal was to lay a solid architectural foundation to build future apps upon. I stuck with Clean architecture and tried to build an app with limited knowledge.
Due to time limitation and limited knowledge, some parts of the code are sloppy, but I think this is a great result for the first project made with Jetpack Compose.
